2. Property or method....is not defined on the instance but referenced during render-
What does Vue error message mean? What causes it, and how do you fix it?

In this example, Vue data (when you create the new Vue app in the script area) only has 3 variables - name, quantity and unit price. But in the template(HTML part), one of the variables is {{total}} - so there is another variable that the Vue instance doesn't know about. 
To fix this issue, you need to define the other variable in the instance, but it is computed from data variables, so it goes in a different section of the Vue instance, - computed: where the function to determine the value is described. 
After defining the {{total}} in the computed: section, the error goes away.
